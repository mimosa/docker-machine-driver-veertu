# docker-machine-driver-veertu
Veertu takes advantage of the Hypervisor.framework that was introduced in OS X 10.10, which brings Type 1 hypervisor technology (direct, host-level access to hardware) to OS X.

There is no current docker-machine-driver for veertu. So I'll investigate the posibility to code one myself.
Why am I? No one, just some random Software Dev/Architect with 10 years of experience in the wild.

Please create/respond an issue if you feel the need for this, advice ideas, etc.
